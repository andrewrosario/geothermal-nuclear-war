## Introduction
Sometime in the 1980s a kid with a computer wants to play a game. 
Little does he know this is game that shouldn't be played...
Step back in time with this simple yet profound callback to an era that was gripped 
with the thought of nuclear annihilation.
No one wins when you play Geothermal-Nuclear War..
